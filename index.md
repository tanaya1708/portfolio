## Personal Projects/Publications

### 1. CoRT Workspace- A Collaborative Real-Time Workspace
#### Mern Stack
##### Ideology
- A Centralised idea using Cloud Technology for techies and people working on various tasks in the same environment individually or in a community using Real-time Collaboration. The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) allows a user to build a new project/file, connect team members to it, Interact, Easy Sharing, and Collaborate work in real-time from a remote location by using the fewest resources possible. The cloud servers will synchronize all project data. Using network sockets, VoIP calls, and video conferences, two or more users working on the same project would be able to connect as well as look at each other's work. It will be possible to compile, run, debug, and distribute the application to local and remote locations. The framework will allow users to run and deploy projects in a variety of versions. Cloud services, in a similar way, are dependable. In similar ways, cloud services are related to every field. Contributors would have the freedom to design plugins for the applications and use them personally and publicly securely.
